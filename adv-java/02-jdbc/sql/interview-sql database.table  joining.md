SQL Interview Questions Based on the Provided Schema
Schema Overview
You have three tables across different databases:

company.companies - Contains company information

department.service - Contains services offered by companies

employee.person - Contains employee information

Basic Questions
1. What types of joins are you familiar with? Can you explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
2. Write a query to get all companies along with their services, including companies that don't offer any services.
sql
Copy
SELECT c.*, s.*
FROM company.companies c
LEFT JOIN department.service s ON c.cname = s.cname;
3. Why is the result of your join query showing only 4 rows when each table has 5 rows?
The INNER JOIN only returns matching records. Since one company ("EduSpark") doesn't have a matching service record in the department.service table, it's excluded from the results.

Intermediate Questions
4. How would you modify your query to include companies without services and services without companies?
sql
Copy
SELECT c.*, s.*
FROM company.companies c
FULL OUTER JOIN department.service s ON c.cname = s.cname;
(Note: MySQL doesn't support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, so you'd need to use UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs)

5. What is the purpose of the CASCADE option in your foreign key constraints?
The CASCADE option ensures that:

When a company is deleted (ON DELETE CASCADE), all related services and employees are automatically deleted

When a company name is updated (ON UPDATE CASCADE), the change propagates to all related services and employees

6. How would you find the average age of employees by industry?
sql
Copy
SELECT c.industry, AVG(p.age) as avg_age
FROM company.companies c
JOIN employee.person p ON c.cname = p.cname
GROUP BY c.industry;
Advanced Questions
7. How would you design a query to show companies founded before 2010 that offer services, along with their youngest employee?
sql
Copy
SELECT c.cname, c.industry, 
       MIN(p.age) as youngest_employee_age,
       (SELECT first_name FROM employee.person 
        WHERE cname = c.cname AND age = MIN(p.age) as youngest_employee_name
FROM company.companies c
JOIN department.service s ON c.cname = s.cname
JOIN employee.person p ON c.cname = p.cname
WHERE c.founded_year < 2010
GROUP BY c.cname, c.industry;
8. What indexes would you recommend for these tables to optimize performance?
Recommended indexes:

company.companies(cname) - Already has a unique constraint (used for foreign keys)

department.service(cname) - Foreign key column

employee.person(cname) - Foreign key column

company.companies(founded_year) - If frequently filtered by year

employee.person(age) - If frequently filtered or sorted by age

9. How would you handle a situation where company names need to change frequently, given your current schema design?
Current design with CASCADE handles name changes well, but alternatives include:

Using a stable company_id as the foreign key instead of cname

Creating a history table to track name changes

Implementing a soft delete system with "current_name" and "previous_names" columns

Database Design Questions
10. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using cname as a foreign key instead of company_id?
Advantages:

More readable in queries (joins show company names directly)

No need for additional joins to get company names

Disadvantages:

Names can change, requiring updates in multiple tables

Names take more space than integer IDs

Potential case-sensitivity issues with string comparisons

Slower joins compared to integer keys

11. How would you modify this schema to track multiple services per company and multiple employees per company?
Current schema already supports this - the issue in the sample data is that each company only has one service and one employee in the examples. The table structures correctly allow multiple records with the same cname in both the service and person tables.

12. What would happen if you tried to delete "TechNova" from the companies table?
Due to the ON DELETE CASCADE constraint:

The TechNova record would be deleted from company.companies

All services with cname = 'TechNova' would be deleted from department.service

All employees with cname = 'TechNova' would be deleted from employee.person

Advanced SQL Interview Questions Based on the Provided Schema
Performance Optimization
13. How would you optimize this query that joins all three tables?
sql
Copy
SELECT c.company_id, c.cname, s.service_id, s.service_name, p.id, p.first_name 
FROM company.companies c 
INNER JOIN department.service s ON c.cname=s.cname 
INNER JOIN employee.person p ON c.cname=p.cname;
Optimization approaches:

Ensure proper indexes exist on join columns (cname in all tables)

Consider using covering indexes for frequently accessed columns

For large datasets, analyze whether all columns are needed or if SELECT * can be replaced

Consider query hints if the optimizer isn't choosing the best plan

14. How would you analyze the performance of this query in MySQL?
sql
Copy
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT c.company_id, c.cname, s.service_id, s.service_name, p.id, p.first_name 
FROM company.companies c 
INNER JOIN department.service s ON c.cname=s.cname 
INNER JOIN employee.person p ON c.cname=p.cname;
Schema Design Deep Dive
15. What normalization form does this schema follow? How would you denormalize it?
The schema appears to be in 3NF (Third Normal Form) because:

All non-key attributes depend on the key

There are no transitive dependencies

Each table serves a single purpose

Denormalization options:

Combine company and service data for read-heavy workloads

Add employee count directly to companies table

Create a materialized view with frequently accessed combined data

16. How would you modify this schema to track historical changes to company names?
Approaches:

Add valid_from and valid_to dates to companies table

Create a company_history table

Use triggers to automatically record changes

Implement a temporal table design

sql
Copy
ALTER TABLE company.companies 
ADD COLUMN valid_from DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN valid_to DATETIME DEFAULT '9999-12-31';

CREATE TABLE company.company_history AS SELECT * FROM company.companies;
ALTER TABLE company.company_history ADD COLUMN version_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
Advanced Query Techniques
17. Write a query to find companies that have services but no employees
sql
Copy
SELECT c.*
FROM company.companies c
JOIN department.service s ON c.cname = s.cname
LEFT JOIN employee.person p ON c.cname = p.cname
WHERE p.id IS NULL;
18. How would you calculate the percentage of companies in each industry that offer services?
sql
Copy
SELECT 
    c.industry,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.cname) AS total_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.cname) AS companies_with_services,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT s.cname) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT c.cname), 2) AS percentage
FROM company.companies c
LEFT JOIN department.service s ON c.cname = s.cname
GROUP BY c.industry;
Transaction and Locking Scenarios
19. How would you ensure data consistency when transferring an employee from one company to another?
sql
Copy
START TRANSACTION;

-- First check both companies exist
SELECT 1 FROM company.companies WHERE cname = 'NewCompany' FOR UPDATE;
SELECT 1 FROM company.companies WHERE cname = 'OldCompany' FOR UPDATE;

-- Update the employee record
UPDATE employee.person 
SET cname = 'NewCompany' 
WHERE id = 1 AND cname = 'OldCompany';

-- Verify only one row was affected
IF ROW_COUNT() = 1 THEN
    COMMIT;
ELSE
    ROLLBACK;
END IF;
Scaling Considerations
20. How would you partition these tables for better performance with millions of records?
Potential partitioning strategies:

Partition companies by industry (LIST partitioning)

Partition services by service_date (RANGE partitioning)

Partition employees by age ranges or alphabetically by last name

sql
Copy
-- Example for companies table
ALTER TABLE company.companies
PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(industry) (
    PARTITION p_tech VALUES IN ('Technology'),
    PARTITION p_health VALUES IN ('Healthcare'),
    PARTITION p_other VALUES IN (DEFAULT)
);
Security Questions
21. How would you implement row-level security so employees can only see data from their own company?
Approach using views and application context:

sql
Copy
CREATE VIEW employee.secure_person AS
SELECT * FROM employee.person 
WHERE cname = SYS_CONTEXT('USER_CTX', 'COMPANY_NAME');

CREATE VIEW department.secure_service AS
SELECT * FROM department.service
WHERE cname = SYS_CONTEXT('USER_CTX', 'COMPANY_NAME');
Data Integrity Challenges
22. How would you prevent a company from being deleted if it has active services or employees?
Two approaches:

Remove CASCADE and implement a pre-delete check:

sql
Copy
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_company_delete
BEFORE DELETE ON company.companies
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DECLARE service_count INT;
    DECLARE employee_count INT;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO service_count FROM department.service WHERE cname = OLD.cname;
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO employee_count FROM employee.person WHERE cname = OLD.cname;
    
    IF service_count > 0 OR employee_count > 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' 
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Cannot delete company with active services or employees';
    END IF;
END;
Use application-level validation before issuing the DELETE

Advanced Analytics
23. Write a query to show the founding year distribution of companies that offer services
sql
Copy
SELECT 
    c.founded_year,
    COUNT(*) AS company_count,
    GROUP_CONCAT(c.cname) AS companies,
    COUNT(s.service_id) AS service_count
FROM company.companies c
LEFT JOIN department.service s ON c.cname = s.cname
GROUP BY c.founded_year
ORDER BY c.founded_year;
24. How would you calculate employee age distribution per industry?
sql
Copy
SELECT 
    c.industry,
    FLOOR(p.age/10)*10 AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    GROUP_CONCAT(p.first_name) AS employees
FROM employee.person p
JOIN company.companies c ON p.cname = c.cname
GROUP BY c.industry, age_group
ORDER BY c.industry, age_group;
Schema Evolution
25. How would you modify this schema to support multiple industries per company?
Approach using a junction table:

sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE company.company_industries (
    company_id INT,
    industry VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (company_id, industry),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES company.companies(company_id)
);

-- Migrate existing data
INSERT INTO company.company_industries
SELECT company_id, industry FROM company.companies;

-- Then alter companies table to remove industry column
ALTER TABLE company.companies DROP COLUMN industry;

Comprehensive SQL Interview Questions & Answers
(Basic to Advanced, Covering Schema, Joins, Indexing, Transactions, and More)

Section 1: SQL Basics
1. What are the different types of SQL JOINs? Explain with examples.
Answer:
SQL JOINs combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

JOIN Type	Description	Example
INNER JOIN	Returns matching rows from both tables	SELECT * FROM companies c INNER JOIN services s ON c.cname = s.cname
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN	Returns all rows from the left table + matched rows from the right	SELECT * FROM companies c LEFT JOIN services s ON c.cname = s.cname
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN	Returns all rows from the right table + matched rows from the left	SELECT * FROM companies c RIGHT JOIN services s ON c.cname = s.cname
FULL (OUTER) JOIN	Returns all rows when there’s a match in either table	SELECT * FROM companies c FULL JOIN services s ON c.cname = s.cname
CROSS JOIN	Returns Cartesian product (all possible combinations)	SELECT * FROM companies CROSS JOIN services
2. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
Answer:

WHERE filters rows before grouping (used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).

HAVING filters groups after aggregation (used with GROUP BY).

Example:

sql
Copy
-- WHERE filters individual rows
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;

-- HAVING filters grouped results
SELECT cname, COUNT(*) FROM employees 
GROUP BY cname 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
3. What is a PRIMARY KEY vs. FOREIGN KEY?
Answer:

Key Type	Description	Example
PRIMARY KEY	Uniquely identifies a row (NOT NULL + UNIQUE)	company_id INT PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY	Enforces referential integrity (links to another table’s PK)	FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES companies(cname)
Section 2: Intermediate SQL (Based on Given Schema)
4. Write a query to find companies with no employees.
Answer:

sql
Copy
SELECT c.* 
FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN employees e ON c.cname = e.cname
WHERE e.id IS NULL;
5. How do you find the oldest employee in each company?
Answer:

sql
Copy
SELECT c.cname, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.age
FROM employees e
JOIN companies c ON e.cname = c.cname
WHERE (e.cname, e.age) IN (
    SELECT cname, MAX(age) 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY cname
);
6. What is an INDEX? When should you use it?
Answer:

Indexes speed up queries but slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.

Best for:

Columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY.

Large tables with frequent searches.

Example:

sql
Copy
CREATE INDEX idx_cname ON companies(cname);  -- Speeds up JOINs on cname
Section 3: Advanced SQL (Performance & Optimization)
7. How would you optimize this query?
sql
Copy
SELECT c.cname, s.service_name, e.first_name
FROM companies c
JOIN services s ON c.cname = s.cname
JOIN employees e ON c.cname = e.cname;
Answer:

Add indexes on cname in all tables.

Use SELECT specific columns instead of *.

Consider partitioning if tables are large.

8. What is a CTE? Write a query to find companies with more than 2 services.
Answer:
A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set.

sql
Copy
WITH CompanyServiceCount AS (
    SELECT cname, COUNT(*) as service_count
    FROM services
    GROUP BY cname
)
SELECT c.* 
FROM companies c
JOIN CompanyServiceCount cs ON c.cname = cs.cname
WHERE cs.service_count > 2;
9. Explain transactions with an example.
Answer:
Transactions ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

sql
Copy
START TRANSACTION;
-- Transfer employee from TechNova to HealthFirst
UPDATE employees SET cname = 'HealthFirst' 
WHERE id = 1 AND cname = 'TechNova';

-- Log the change
INSERT INTO employee_transfers (emp_id, old_company, new_company) 
VALUES (1, 'TechNova', 'HealthFirst');

COMMIT;  -- Or ROLLBACK if error
Section 4: Database Design
10. How would you track historical company name changes?
Answer:
Option 1: Add valid_from and valid_to timestamps.
Option 2: Create a company_history table.

sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE company_history (
    history_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INT,
    old_name VARCHAR(100),
    new_name VARCHAR(100),
    change_date TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(company_id)
);
11. What is normalization? Is this schema normalized?
Answer:

Normalization reduces redundancy (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).

This schema is in 3NF because:

No repeating groups (1NF).

All non-key fields depend on the PK (2NF).

No transitive dependencies (3NF).

Section 5: Advanced Analytics
12. Write a query to show employee age distribution by industry.
Answer:

sql
Copy
SELECT 
    c.industry,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.age < 30 THEN 'Under 30'
        WHEN e.age BETWEEN 30 AND 50 THEN '30-50'
        ELSE 'Over 50'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees e
JOIN companies c ON e.cname = c.cname
GROUP BY c.industry, age_group
ORDER BY c.industry, age_group;
Section 6: Security & Maintenance
13. How would you implement row-level security?
Answer:
Use views + application roles:

sql
Copy
CREATE VIEW employee_data AS
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE cname = CURRENT_USER_COMPANY();  -- Hypothetical function
14. What is deadlock? How can you prevent it?
Answer:

Deadlock: Two transactions block each other.

Prevention:

Use consistent transaction order.

Keep transactions short.

Use NOWAIT or SKIP LOCKED in MySQL

Primary Key vs Foreign Key
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

A foreign key is used to create a relationship between two tables by referring to a primary key (or a unique key) in another table.

🔹 Foreign Key Reference:
You can use a non-primary column (like cname) as a foreign key, as long as it is either unique or indexed in the parent table (in this case, the company.companies table).

By default, foreign keys refer to primary keys or unique keys. If cname is not a primary key but still unique in company.companies, you can reference it as a foreign key.

🔹 What to do in this case?
If cname is meant to uniquely identify a company, then you should create a unique constraint on cname in the company.companies table. This ensures that each company name is unique and can be referenced as a foreign key in other tables.

🔹 How to Ensure cname is Unique:
You can create a unique index on cname in the company.companies table, which will allow it to be used as a foreign key.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Ensure 'cname' is unique in company.companies table
ALTER TABLE company.companies
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cname UNIQUE (cname);
This will allow cname to be used as a foreign key in the employee.person and department.service tables.

🔹 In Summary:
Primary Key: Not required for cname to be referenced as a foreign key.

Unique Constraint: You only need cname to be unique (through a UNIQUE constraint or primary key) in the parent table (company.companies).

Foreign Key: You can reference cname in other tables if it's unique.

Example Schema Update:
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Create unique constraint on 'cname' in companies table
ALTER TABLE company.companies
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cname UNIQUE (cname);

-- Add foreign key for employee.person table

You said:
is compulsy to unique


ChatGPT said:
No, it is not compulsory for the cname column to be unique in the company.companies table in order to reference it as a foreign key. However, there are some important points to consider:

🔹 What You Need for a Foreign Key:
A foreign key must reference a primary key or a unique key in another table. The referenced column needs to have unique values to ensure each foreign key entry can correctly map to a valid record in the parent table.

🔹 Can cname Be Non-Unique?
If cname is not unique in the company.companies table (i.e., multiple companies could have the same company name), you can still reference it as a foreign key in other tables if it is indexed, but this would be less ideal.

🔹 Why Unique is Preferred:
The reason for making cname unique (through a UNIQUE constraint) is to ensure that there is only one company per cname. This way, every time a foreign key references cname, it refers to exactly one company, preventing ambiguity.

If cname is not unique, you could run into issues where an employee or service is linked to multiple companies with the same name, leading to data integrity problems.

🔹 What to Do:
If you want to enforce that each company name is unique and avoid issues with duplicate company names, it’s best to make cname unique.

If it's okay for cname to be non-unique, you can still create a foreign key, but it would refer to potentially multiple companies with the same name, which might cause confusion.

🔹 Scenario 1: cname is Unique (Recommended)
Add a unique constraint on cname to make sure each company name is distinct:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE company.companies
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cname UNIQUE (cname);
This will allow you to use cname as a safe foreign key.

🔹 Scenario 2: cname is Not Unique (Less Ideal)
You can still use cname as a foreign key, but you should be aware of the potential data integrity issues:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Foreign key without uniqueness on cname (less ideal)
ALTER TABLE employee.person
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_employee_company
FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES company.companies(cname)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
🔹 Conclusion:
Unique is highly recommended for ensuring data integrity, but it is not strictly required if you don’t mind having multiple companies with the same cname.

If you choose not to make cname unique, just be cautious about how you handle the data.

The error you're encountering—"Missing index for constraint"—occurs because the column you're trying to reference (cname) in company.companies is not indexed. For a foreign key to work, the referenced column in the parent table must be either a primary key or unique, and it must be indexed.

Here's what you need to do:
Ensure cname in company.companies is unique or indexed. If it is not already indexed, you need to create a unique index on cname.

Step 1: Add a Unique Index on cname in company.companies
You need to create a unique index on the cname column in the company.companies table to make it valid for referencing by the foreign key:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE company.companies
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cname UNIQUE (cname);
This will create a unique constraint on the cname column, ensuring that each company name is unique, and it can be referenced by the foreign key in the department.service table.

Step 2: Add the Foreign Key Constraint Again
Now that cname in company.companies is indexed (and unique), you can proceed with adding the foreign key in the department.service table:


ALTER TABLE department.service
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_cname
FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES company.companies(cname)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
Summary of Steps:
Add a unique constraint on cname in company.companies.

Add the foreign key constraint on cname in department.service.

This should resolve the issue and allow the foreign key constraint to be successfully added.


*Important Note:

Yes, your statement is correct. For a column in a table to be referenced by a foreign key in another table, the parent column (the column in the referenced table) must have either a primary key, unique key, or be indexed. Here’s a breakdown of why this is the case:

🔑 Foreign Key Requirements:
Primary Key:

A primary key is a special case of unique key.

Every primary key is automatically indexed.

A foreign key must reference a primary key or a unique key in the parent table to ensure the referenced column has unique values.

Unique Key:

A unique key ensures that every value in the column is distinct. This is similar to a primary key but allows NULL values (except in some cases, depending on database engine).

The foreign key must reference a unique key or primary key to avoid ambiguity in the relationship.

Indexed Column:

The column being referenced by the foreign key must be indexed. In most cases, when you create a primary or unique key, an index is automatically created on that column.

An index ensures that searches for values in the referenced column are efficient. However, it’s not mandatory to create an index explicitly on the referenced column unless you have a unique constraint.

🔹 Key Points to Remember:
The column in the referenced table (parent table) must either be a:

Primary key, or

Unique key, or

Indexed column (usually either primary or unique).

The foreign key column in the child table can be any column, but it must reference the column in the parent table with one of the above constraints.

Example:
Parent Table (company.companies):

You need a unique key or primary key on the cname column to be able to reference it with a foreign key.

Child Table (employee.person):

The cname column in this table can then reference the cname column in the company.companies table because it's unique (or indexed).

SQL Example to Ensure cname is Unique:
sql
-- Create a unique constraint on the 'cname' column in the 'company.companies' table
ALTER TABLE company.companies
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cname UNIQUE (cname);
Conclusion:
To sum up, yes, the parent table's column being referenced by the foreign key must be indexed, and the column should ideally be unique or a primary key to ensure data integrity and avoid ambiguity.


No, it is not compulsory to have a foreign key in a table in order to join that table with other tables.

Joining Tables Without Foreign Keys:
Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that relationships between tables are valid. However, foreign keys are not required to perform SQL JOINs.

You can join tables based on any matching columns, even if those columns are not explicitly defined as foreign keys or primary keys.

What is a JOIN?
A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, but this column doesn't have to be a foreign key.

Example of JOIN without Foreign Keys:
Assume we have two tables:

employees:

emp_id, first_name, last_name, dept_id

departments:

dept_id, dept_name

You can join the tables like this:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
Here, dept_id is being used to join the tables, but it's not a foreign key (it could be just an ordinary column in both tables). The join works fine as long as the column exists and the values match between the two tables.

Foreign Key vs JOIN:
Foreign Key: A foreign key helps to enforce data integrity by ensuring that a value in one table corresponds to a valid value in another table. It is used to maintain relationships between tables.

JOIN: A JOIN is just a way to retrieve related data from multiple tables, based on common columns. It doesn't require foreign keys to work, as long as there’s a column in both tables with related data.

Why Use Foreign Keys?
Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures that the relationships between tables are valid and consistent.

Cascade Operations: You can set up cascading updates or deletions with foreign keys.

Data Validation: A foreign key prevents the insertion of data that doesn’t correspond to any valid entry in the referenced table.

Example Without Foreign Keys (But Still Valid Join):
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Assume we join two tables: orders and customers
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
Here, customer_id is used to join the two tables, but there may not necessarily be a foreign key constraint between these columns in the database schema. It’s just matching values from both tables.

In Summary:
Foreign keys are not required for joining tables. They are useful for maintaining data integrity but not necessary for joining data.

JOINS simply work based on common columns, regardless of whether they are foreign keys or not.

Uniqueness is not required for a join to work. The join will still return results even if the columns are not unique.

Uniqueness becomes important when using foreign keys (referential integrity) or when you need to avoid duplicate results in certain queries.

*important note : requirements for join:
Conclusion:
The values do not need to be exactly the same in every case, but they must logically correspond or match the type you are trying to join on.
They must be compatible data types (e.g., integers, strings).
You may need to handle cases where the values are close but not identical (e.g., case sensitivity, partial matches, or formatting differences).

Schema Evolution

25. How would you modify this schema to support multiple industries per company?
Approach using a junction table:

sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE company.company_industries (
    company_id INT,
    industry VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (company_id, industry),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES company.companies(company_id)
);

-- Migrate existing data
INSERT INTO company.company_industries
SELECT company_id, industry FROM company.companies;

-- Then alter companies table to remove industry column
ALTER TABLE company.companies DROP COLUMN industry;
